FreeRTOS Example

This application utilizes FreeRTOS to perform a variety of tasks in a
concurrent fashion.  The following tasks are created:

* An lwIP task, which serves up web pages via the Ethernet interface.  This
  is actually two tasks, one which runs the lwIP stack and one which
  manages the Ethernet interface (sending and receiving raw packets).

* There is an automatically created idle task, which monitors changes in
  the board's IP address and sends those changes to the user via a UART
  message.

The finder application (in tools/finder) can also be used to discover the
IP address of the board.  The finder application will search the network
for all boards that respond to its requests and display information about
them.
